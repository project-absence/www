The config file is the file that is used to configure each module individually. Its **default path** is `~/.absence/config.toml` and has the following **default content**:

```toml title="~/.absence/config.toml"
[banner_grabber]
enabled = false

[domain_takeover]
enabled = false

[dork]
enabled = false

[enumerate_files]
enabled = false

[enumerate_subdomains]
enabled = false

[enumerate_vhosts]
enabled = false

[passive_dns]
enabled = false

[port_scanner]
enabled = false

[screenshot_grabber]
enabled = false
```

Every module can be `enabled` by setting its value to `true`. Some modules have settings that can be set specifically for that module only; see the page of the modules to know what can be set.
